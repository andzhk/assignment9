# How to ideally implement SEO in our website

- First step is to do a keyword search and make a proper plan for SEO and use relevant terms. Like our website is related to movies and shows. So, search for keywords which are relevant to that. Keywords plays an important role in SEO. A keyword indicates the main context of your article and itâ€™s what makes it possible for users to find your content once they do an online search for any topic of interest.
- Place those keywords throughout the website, all the pages of the website.

## Ideally we will add keywords in the following places:

- Title of the post
- The URL
- The first and last paragraph of the post
- In the text organically throughout the post
- The tags of images used

- We will try to write high quality content in our website without any keyword stuffing.
- Optimize images is also an important thing in SEO implementation, using heavy images can make our website slow so we should use well optimized images in our webpages.
- Mobile version of the website needs to be well maintained because most of the traffic on website usually comes from mobile phone users.
